# OlostepExt
The JavaScript library for olostep.com â€” earn tips and monetize your chrome extension in minutes without servers

## Documentation

For the installation guide and more details read the official [docs](https://docs.olostep.com/introduction).

## Information
This library uses [Mozilla's webextension-polyfill library](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) internally for compatability across browsers which means it should work on almost all modern browsers.
For now, the only regularly tested browser is Chrome, but it should work on Firefox, Edge, Opera, and Brave. If you find a compatibility bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/olostep/olostep-extensions/issues/new).


The library works both for manifest v2 and v3.


**Note**: The Olostep JS Library doesn't track your users. This library only communicates with Olostep's servers to process tips/donations.
